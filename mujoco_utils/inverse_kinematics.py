    """Finds joint angles qpos such that the given model sites xpos match
    the target site positions.

    Minimizes the inverse kinematics objective:

    objective = ||s(q)-s*||^2 + a||q||^2

    Where s(q) are site positions as functions of joint angles q
    and s* is the target site positions (data). Only translational
    error is computed for now (rotational error is not computed.)

    TODO: Add support for indices in addition to string names in site_names.
    TODO: Add support for indices in addition to string names in joint_names.
    TODO: Add dtype enforcing to other funtions in this module,
        like dtype = physics.data.qpos.dtype.
    TODO: Maybe add gradient clipping and joint range clipping.
    TODO: Maybe add tol precision goal.

    Args:
        physics: mjcf.Physics instance.
        site_names: List of names of model sites to be matched to data.
        target_xpos: Numpy array of target site positions, (n_sites, 3).
        joint_names: List of joint names to modify by inverse kinematics.
        reg_strength: Coefficient `a` of the quadratic penalty on joint
        deviations from reference (defaults) pose.
        lr: Learning rate for gradient descent.
        beta: Momentum beta, zero means no momentum (reduces to plain
            gradient descent in this case.) With momentum, the weight
            of the previous grad updates is on the order ~beta/(1-beta),
            and the weight of the current grad is ~1.
        progress_threshold: Stop optimization when the ratio
            gradient_update / err_norm becomes smaller than progress threshold.
            Setting progress_threshold to zero means no threshold and
            the update can get arbitrarily small.
        max_steps: Maximum number of iterations to perform.
        include_inds: Which Cartesian components of the site coordinates
            to include in the objective calculation. All included by default.
            The indices are w.r.t. target_xpos.flattened().
            For example, to include only the x, y components of all sites
            (in other words, to exclude the z-component), use
            include_inds = [0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, ...], and so on.
        inplace: If True, physics.data will be modified in place.
            Defaults to False, i.e. a copy of physics.data will be made.

    Returns:
        A namedtuple containing the joint angles qpos, translational
            residuals, and number of steps. It also contains the objective's
            first term error for assessing regularization strength and pure
            site position error.
